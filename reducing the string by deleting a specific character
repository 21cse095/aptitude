explanation
You are given a binary string S.
You can perform the following operations on S any number of times (possibly zero): 
• Select an index i such that S[i] is equal 1 and S[i+1] is equal to 0 for 0 ≤ i < len(S) -1. 
• Remove exactly one of the character from S. to Find the smallest string S that you can get after performing operations on S.

Sample Input  110	
Sample output  0
Explanation 3 Here, S = "110" We can perform two operations on S as :- 
1. Select the index 1 and 2 and remove the character at index 1. 
Then S becomes "10". 2. Select the index 0 and 1 and remove the character at index 0.
Then S becomes "0". Hence, S after performing operations is equal to "0"
